# CCGS-BattleBot-App
 
Uploaded as past of my `something awesome` project for UNSW HS1917.

I highly suggest no one attempt to decipher this joke of an application :D.

Is an ionic angular mobile app which communicates to a python server using websockets. Built with the intention of being a cross-platform remote control for small diy robots, specifically the CCGS Robotics BattleBots.
